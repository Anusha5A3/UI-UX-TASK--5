# UI-UX-TASK--5


This prototype demonstrates a To-Do List App called “Organize Your Life.”
The user starts from a Welcome page, signs up, views categorized tasks on the Dashboard, and checks task stats and settings on the Profile page.
The prototype links all screens with smooth navigation and simple animations to simulate real app flow.
